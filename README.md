# Welcome to my NBA Analytics Repo!

Here I am extracting data from past and the previous NBA seasons to consolidate player performance. 

My next step is to build a model where I can attempt to predict future player performance based on past performance, age, and time spent in the league.

Please run the 1-orchestration-engine.ipynb file before running the visuals for the most up-to-date data. Visuals can display data in yearly totals, per-36, and per-game basis.

### IMPORTANT: If you wish to raise any PRs or contribute, you are more than welcome to fork my repo. I kindly ask that you raise any PRs to merge to the develop branch. 

After testing and ensuring my code works correctly, I will then merge everything into the higher-level branches.
